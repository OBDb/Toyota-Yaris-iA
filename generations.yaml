    description: "The Toyota Yaris iA represented a unique product in Toyota's North American lineup—a subcompact sedan that was actually a rebadged Mazda2 sedan (known as the Mazda Demio in some markets), initially sold under Toyota's now-discontinued Scion brand as the Scion iA before transitioning to Toyota badging for the 2017 model year when the Scion brand was eliminated. Featuring distinctly Mazda-derived styling with Toyota/Scion badges added, the Yaris iA stood apart from the Toyota-designed Yaris hatchback sold alongside it, creating a somewhat confusing situation where two different vehicles shared the Yaris nameplate in North America. Powered by Mazda's 1.5-liter Skyactiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 106 horsepower, paired with either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels, the Yaris iA offered more engaging driving dynamics than typical for the segment, reflecting its Mazda engineering. The interior was similarly Mazda-derived, featuring a driver-focused cockpit with a standard 7-inch touchscreen that could also be controlled via a rotary knob, higher quality materials than the Toyota-designed Yaris, and a more premium overall feel. In an unusual approach for Toyota, the Yaris iA was offered in a single, well-equipped trim level with minimal options, reflecting its origins as a Scion product where the 'mono-spec' approach was standard practice. Standard features included forward collision warning with low-speed automatic emergency braking, a rearview camera, keyless entry, and cruise control—a generous equipment level for an entry-level vehicle of this era. The Yaris iA found modest success by offering the reliability reputation of the Toyota brand combined with Mazda's strengths in driving dynamics and interior quality, providing an alternative for subcompact sedan buyers seeking a more engaging driving experience than typical economy cars."

    description: "For the 2019 model year, the rebadged Mazda2 sedan was rebranded as the Toyota Yaris Sedan and received a minor facelift. The facelift introduced new trim levels (L, LE, XLE) with a variety of interior and exterior options, replacing the previous monospec approach. The vehicle retained its Mazda-derived 1.5-liter Skyactiv-G engine producing 106 horsepower, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission (the manual transmission was discontinued). Exterior changes included subtle but noticeable updates to the front and rear styling, while interior enhancements included updated trim materials and additional convenience features across the higher trim levels. Safety features continued to be comprehensive for the segment, with forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking standard. Despite these updates, the model was discontinued after the 2020 model year when Toyota withdrew from the subcompact sedan segment in North America entirely."
